# Mythic

Mythic is a starter theme for WordPress.

The theme's primary goal is to offer a modern development experience for WordPress theme authors while sticking as close to possible to WordPress standards as we can.  Sometimes those things don't always mesh well.  This theme aims to balance that.

## Requirements

There's a few requirements in order to develop a new theme or contribute back to the project:

* PHP 5.6+ (preferably 7+).
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for managing PHP dependencies.
* [Node 8+](https://nodejs.org).
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (your choice) for managing JS dependencies.

You should feel reasonably comfortable using the command line. The theme tries to keep this as simple as possible, but some command line knowledge is necessary in modern development.
